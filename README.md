# FPGA Basys 3 DJ board
## Logic Design Experiment Final Project
## Description
### This is a DJ music interface implemented on FPGA board using Verilog. The main difficulty of this project is to transform the sound signal of each instrument into real sound. We do a research about the principle of sampling and make the sound of each instrument played on the FPGA board. About more details, please refer to the [Group04_report.pdf](https://github.com/CHIUWEINING/DjBoard/tree/master/Group04_report.pdf) (in Chinese).
